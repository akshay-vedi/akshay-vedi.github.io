      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every year on my birthday I give myself something special. I am so glad I gave me this read this time. All my life at least as far as I remember, I hate the fact that I have to sleep; I always want to do something/think something, whether it be productive or unproductive(I love to just sit and think). There was a time in my life(teenage) where I, as most of the best engineering colleges&#39; aspirants in India, was forcing myself to bring the best out of me, once forced myself to less than 5 hours of sleep for many number of days. Not even this, having lived in a hostel, and away from my family for a long time, I have also had days where I have slept a lot. Clearly, abusing sleep all my life, as do most of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, Walker very desperately explains why the human body needs sleep, and why the humans who say that sleep is not necessary are trying to act against the nature. He has rationalized all the information based on scientific and medical studies that have gone on for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
